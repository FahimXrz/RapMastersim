# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Guide for RapMaster Simulator

## Prerequisites ✅

Before deploying, make sure you have:
- [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed
- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
- A [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account (free)

## 📋 Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Prepare Your Project

Your project should have this structure:
```
raprise-simulator/
├── package.json          ✅ Created
├── index.html            ✅ Created  
├── vite.config.ts        ✅ Created
├── vercel.json           ✅ Created
├── src/
│   └── main.tsx          ✅ Created
├── App.tsx               ✅ Existing
├── components/           ✅ Existing
├── styles/               ✅ Existing
└── public/
    └── favicon.ico       ✅ Created
```

### 2. Initialize Git Repository (if not done)

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd raprise-simulator

# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit files
git commit -m "Initial commit: RapMaster Simulator ready for deployment"
```

### 3. Push to GitHub

**Option A: Create new repository on GitHub**
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) → New Repository
2. Name it `raprise-simulator`
3. Don't initialize with README (you already have one)
4. Copy the repository URL

**Option B: Use GitHub CLI**
```bash
gh repo create raprise-simulator --public --push
```

**Option C: Manual push**
```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/raprise-simulator.git

# Push to main branch
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Deploy on Vercel

**Method 1: Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)**

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your `raprise-simulator` repository
5. Vercel will automatically detect it's a Vite project
6. Click "Deploy"

**Method 2: Vercel CLI**

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally
npm i -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy from your project directory
vercel

# Follow the prompts:
# - Set up and deploy? Yes
# - Which scope? (select yours)
# - Link to existing project? No
# - Project name? raprise-simulator
# - Directory? ./
```

### 5. Configure Domain (Optional)

After deployment:
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to "Settings" → "Domains"
4. Add a custom domain or use the provided `.vercel.app` URL

## 🔧 Environment Variables (if needed)

If you need to add environment variables:

1. In Vercel Dashboard → Project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add any required variables (none needed for basic deployment)

## 🛠️ Build Configuration

Your `vercel.json` is pre-configured with:
- ✅ Build command: `npm run build`
- ✅ Output directory: `dist`
- ✅ SPA routing support
- ✅ Asset caching headers

## 📱 Post-Deployment Checklist

After deployment, verify:
- [ ] Game loads properly on mobile
- [ ] Character creation works
- [ ] All navigation functions
- [ ] Skills upgrade system works
- [ ] Music creation features work
- [ ] Social media tabs display correctly
- [ ] Responsive design on different screen sizes

## 🔄 Continuous Deployment

Once connected to GitHub:
- Every push to `main` branch automatically deploys
- Pull requests create preview deployments
- Rollback available through Vercel dashboard

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

Your build includes:
- ✅ Code splitting for React/UI libraries
- ✅ Asset optimization
- ✅ Long-term caching for static assets
- ✅ Gzip compression
- ✅ Mobile-first responsive design

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Build fails?**
- Check that all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Verify TypeScript files compile locally with `npm run build`

**App doesn't load?**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify all imports are correct
- Ensure `src/main.tsx` is importing `App.tsx` correctly

**Styling issues?**
- Verify Tailwind CSS is building correctly
- Check that `globals.css` is being imported

## 📊 Deployment Result
